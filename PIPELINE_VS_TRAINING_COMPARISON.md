## Overview

This project includes **two distinct approaches** to adversarial robustness:

### 1. **Adversarial Pipeline** (`adversarial_pipeline.py`)
**Purpose**: **Evaluate** the robustness of an existing pre-trained model

**What it does**:
- Takes a pre-trained model (already trained on clean data)
- Tests it against adversarial attacks
- Measures how vulnerable it is
- **Does NOT modify or improve the model**

**Analogy**: Like a security audit - you're testing existing defenses

### 2. **Adversarial Training** (`adversarial_training.py`)
**Purpose**: **Improve** model robustness by training with adversarial examples

**What it does**:
- Trains a model from scratch (or fine-tunes)
- Includes adversarial examples during training
- Creates a more robust model
- **Modifies the model to be stronger**

**Analogy**: Like hardening defenses - you're building better protection

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Adversarial Pipeline | Adversarial Training |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Purpose** | Evaluation & Testing | Defense & Mitigation |
| **Model State** | Pre-trained (frozen) | Training (updating weights) |
| **Computational Cost** | Low (~5-15 min) | High (~30-90 min) |
| **GPU Requirement** | Optional | Strongly recommended |
| **Output** | Vulnerability metrics | Robust model + metrics |
| **Model Changes** |  No changes |  Model improved |
| **Primary Goal** | "How vulnerable is my model?" | "How can I make it robust?" |
| **Use Case** | Assessment, Research | Production, Deployment |

## Adversarial Pipeline (Evaluation)

### What It Is

A **diagnostic tool** that evaluates existing model robustness without any training.

### Process Flow

```
Pre-trained Model (ResNet-18)
         ↓
   Load Model (frozen)
         ↓
   Generate Adversarial Examples
   ├── FGSM Attack
   └── PGD Attack
         ↓
   Evaluate Accuracy
   ├── Clean Data: ~85-90%
   ├── FGSM Attack: ~40-50%
   └── PGD Attack: ~10-25%
         ↓
   Generate Visualizations & Reports
```

### Key Characteristics

** Advantages**:
- **Fast**: Completes in 5-15 minutes
- **No training needed**: Works with any pre-trained model
- **Low resource**: Runs on CPU (GPU optional)
- **Comprehensive analysis**: Detailed vulnerability assessment

** Limitations**:
- **Read-only**: Doesn't improve the model
- **Static**: Model remains vulnerable after evaluation
- **No defense**: Only identifies problems, doesn't fix them

### Expected Results

#### Clean Accuracy
```
ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10: ~85-90%
(Pre-trained model performance on normal images)
```

#### Adversarial Accuracy
```
FGSM (ε=0.03):  ~40-50%  (40-50% accuracy drop)
PGD (ε=0.03):   ~10-25%  (60-75% accuracy drop)
```

**Interpretation**:
- Large accuracy drop = Model is vulnerable
- FGSM is weaker, PGD is stronger
- Results show the model is NOT robust by default

model = load_pretrained_model()  # Frozen, no training

# Generate attacks
x_adv_fgsm = fgsm_attack.generate(x_clean)
x_adv_pgd = pgd_attack.generate(x_clean)

# Evaluate (model unchanged)
clean_acc = evaluate(model, x_clean)      # ~85%
fgsm_acc = evaluate(model, x_adv_fgsm)    # ~45%
pgd_acc = evaluate(model, x_adv_pgd)      # ~15%
```

## Adversarial Training (Mitigation)

### What It Is

A **defense mechanism** that trains models to be robust by including adversarial examples during training.

### Process Flow

```
Standard Model Training          Adversarial Training
(Clean Data Only)         vs     (Clean + Adversarial Data)
         ↓                                 ↓
   Train on Clean              Train on Clean + Adversarial
         ↓                                 ↓
   Clean Acc: ~85%                  Clean Acc: ~75-80%
   FGSM Acc: ~40%                   FGSM Acc: ~60-70%
   PGD Acc: ~10%                    PGD Acc: ~40-55%
         ↓                                 ↓
   Vulnerable Model                 Robust Model
```

### Key Characteristics

** Advantages**:
- **Creates robustness**: Model learns to resist attacks
- **Generalizes**: Often robust to attacks it wasn't trained on
- **Production-ready**: Can deploy robust models
- **Transferable**: Works across different attack types

** Limitations**:
- **Slow**: Takes 30-90 minutes (or hours for full training)
- **Resource-intensive**: Requires good GPU
- **Clean accuracy trade-off**: May sacrifice 5-15% clean accuracy
- **Expensive**: ~40× slower than standard training

### Training Algorithm

```python
for epoch in epochs:
    for batch in training_data:
        # Get clean images
        x_clean, y_true = batch

        # Generate adversarial examples
        model.eval()
        with torch.no_grad():
            x_adv = pgd_attack.generate(x_clean)
        model.train()

        # Train on BOTH clean and adversarial
        loss_clean = loss_fn(model(x_clean), y_true)
        loss_adv = loss_fn(model(x_adv), y_true)

        # Combined loss (α = balance parameter)
        loss = (1-α) * loss_clean + α * loss_adv

        # Update model weights
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### Expected Results

#### Standard Training (Baseline)
```
Clean Accuracy:     ~85%
FGSM Accuracy:      ~40%  (45% drop)
PGD Accuracy:       ~10%  (75% drop)

Conclusion: Vulnerable to attacks
```

#### Adversarial Training (α=0.5)
```
Clean Accuracy:     ~75-80%  (5-10% drop from baseline)
FGSM Accuracy:      ~60-70%  (20-30% improvement)
PGD Accuracy:       ~40-55%  (30-45% improvement)

Conclusion: Much more robust, acceptable clean accuracy trade-off
```

## When to Use Each

### Use Adversarial Pipeline When:

 **Evaluating existing models**
- You have a pre-trained model and want to test its robustness
- Quick security audit needed
- Research: comparing different architectures' vulnerabilities

 **Initial assessment**
- First step: understand current vulnerability level
- Before deciding whether to invest in adversarial training
- Baseline measurements for comparison

 **Limited resources**
- No GPU available or limited compute budget
- Need quick results (minutes, not hours)
- Exploring multiple models quickly

 **Analysis and research**
- Studying attack transferability
- Comparing attack methods (FGSM vs PGD)
- Understanding adversarial examples visually

**Example Scenarios**:
```
Scenario 1: "Is my model safe to deploy in adversarial settings?"
→ Use Pipeline: Quick 10-minute evaluation shows vulnerability

Scenario 2: "Which architecture is more robust: ResNet vs VGG?"
→ Use Pipeline: Test both models without retraining

Scenario 3: "What does an adversarial example look like?"
→ Use Pipeline: Generate and visualize examples
```

### Use Adversarial Training When:

 **Building production systems**
- Model will face real-world adversarial attacks
- Security is critical (e.g., malware detection, spam filtering)
- Adversarial robustness is a requirement

 **Improving model robustness**
- Pipeline showed significant vulnerabilities
- Need to harden defenses
- Willing to trade some clean accuracy for robustness

 **Research on defenses**
- Testing mitigation strategies
- Comparing defense effectiveness
- Publishing robustness benchmarks

 **Long-term deployment**
- Model will be deployed for extended periods
- Updates are expensive or infrequent
- Robust-by-design approach needed

**Example Scenarios**:
```
Scenario 1: "Our spam filter is being fooled by adversarial emails"
→ Use Training: Retrain with adversarial examples to resist attacks

Scenario 2: "Medical image classifier must be robust to perturbations"
→ Use Training: Safety-critical application requires robustness

Scenario 3: "Pipeline showed 70% accuracy drop under attack"
→ Use Training: Improve model to reduce vulnerability
```

### Parameter Tuning Guide

#### For Pipeline (Evaluation)

```python
# Faster evaluation (less precise)
NUM_TEST_SAMPLES = 500
EPSILON = 0.03
max_iter = 20  # PGD iterations

# More thorough evaluation (slower)
NUM_TEST_SAMPLES = 5000
EPSILON = 0.03
max_iter = 100
```

#### For Training (Defense)

```python
# Quick training (lower robustness)
epochs = 5
alpha = 0.3  # Less adversarial examples
max_iter = 7  # Weaker attacks

# Strong training (better robustness)
epochs = 20
alpha = 0.7  # More adversarial examples
max_iter = 10  # Stronger attacks

# Balanced (recommended)
epochs = 10
alpha = 0.5  # Equal mix
max_iter = 10  # Moderate attacks
```

## Conclusion

Both tools serve **complementary purposes**:

- **Pipeline**: Quick diagnosis ("How vulnerable am I?")
- **Training**: Long-term solution ("Make me robust!")

**Recommended workflow**: Pipeline → Training → Pipeline
1. Evaluate vulnerability
2. Build robustness
3. Verify improvement

This ensures you build robust models based on measured needs, not assumptions.
