ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS
================================================================================

1. ATTACK EFFECTIVENESS:

   - Most effective attack: FGSM (accuracy dropped to 8.60%)
   - Least effective attack: PGD (accuracy dropped to 9.20%)

2. CONCEPTUAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ATTACKS:

   FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method):
   - Single-step attack using the sign of the gradient
   - Fast to compute but less sophisticated
   - Perturbation: x_adv = x + ε * sign(∇_x L(θ, x, y))
   - Pros: Very fast, good for adversarial training
   - Cons: Less effective than iterative methods

   PGD (Projected Gradient Descent):
   - Iterative attack with multiple small steps
   - Projects perturbation back to epsilon ball after each step
   - Considered one of the strongest first-order attacks
   - Pros: More effective, better explores adversarial space
   - Cons: Computationally expensive (multiple iterations)

3. OBSERVED VULNERABILITIES:

   - The model shows RELATIVELY LOW vulnerability to adversarial attacks
   - Average accuracy drop: 0.40%
   - The model exhibits some inherent robustness

4. MITIGATION STRATEGIES:

   Recommended approaches to improve adversarial robustness:

   a) Adversarial Training:
      - Train on mix of clean and adversarial examples
      - Use PGD-generated adversarial examples during training
      - Most effective defense but computationally expensive

   b) Input Preprocessing:
      - Apply transformations (JPEG compression, bit-depth reduction)
      - Use denoising autoencoders
      - Random resizing and padding

   c) Certified Defenses:
      - Randomized smoothing
      - Provable robustness guarantees within epsilon ball
      - Trade-off between robustness and accuracy

   d) Ensemble Methods:
      - Use multiple models with different architectures
      - Adversarial examples may not transfer well
      - Increases computational cost

   e) Detection Methods:
      - Train adversarial example detectors
      - Reject suspicious inputs
      - Can be bypassed by adaptive attacks

5. RECOMMENDATIONS:

   Based on the evaluation results:
   - Priority: Implement adversarial training with PGD (ε=0.03)
   - Consider: Input preprocessing as additional defense layer
   - Evaluate: Trade-off between clean and robust accuracy
   - Monitor: Model performance on diverse adversarial attacks
